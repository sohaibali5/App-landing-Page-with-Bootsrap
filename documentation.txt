first step is to add 
index and style file
then copy the code of starter template from https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/ and pasted in index <body>
then provided icon link <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.15.3/css/all.min.css" integrity="sha512-iBBXm8fW90+nuLcSKlbmrPcLa0OT92xO1BIsZ+ywDWZCvqsWgccV3gFoRBv0z+8dLJgyAHIhR35VZc2oM/gI1w==" crossorigin="anonymous" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" />
  in <head > 
then downloaded SVG file and added it in our folder 
then pasted font link in css file

@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Bebas+Neue&family=Poppins:wght@100;200&display=swap');
/* font-family: 'Bebas Neue', cursive;
font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif; */

SSecond step navigation bar 	
copied navbar code in body from 
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/navbar/
now to place in center remove fluid in <div class="container-fluid">
for placing navigation in right sides put ms-auto in    <ul class="navbar-nav _______(ms-auto)        ">
removing disable class in last element also /* tabindex="-1" aria-disabled="true"*/

now adding some CSS on page in * and body tags 
and we have to make navbar transparent so removing bg-light in    <nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-light bg-light">
also  put navbar-dark inplace of navbar-light

changing list disable element to download button and adding some external css in it by providng class(btn-0)

now we will add our logo in place of Navbar element  <a class="navbar-brand" href="#">Navbar  </a> change it to
                                                     <a class="navbar-brand" href="#">  <i class="fas fa-biking fa-2x"> </i> fitApp</a>

change the font by appliying css to its parent div.navbar-brand 
now giving  colour to .logo by adding class logo in its tag 

now we have to add our text and  svg and two buttons  after nav  with in one grid system 
text is set with existing classes of bootstrap
while svg needs some external css(heigh,width) so putting in .img
now they  needs to be set in center so we will use flex box property 

now text and svg is set so we will add two buttons after our text<p>
